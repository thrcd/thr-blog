Over the past year, it feels like I've been constantly on the moveâ€”but not in the way that keeps you healthy and fit.
Instead, I've been caught up in a whirlwind of stuff that seemed urgent or important.

From working my 8-to-4 job to pursuing hobbies, learning new things, studying, and working on personal projects, my days, and hours have been jam-packed.
This week, driving to Chicago, I had nearly three hours of alone time on the highway, giving me a moment to reflect.

As I drove, I couldn't help but think about everything I've been doing lately. I started to question myself: What really matters? 
It's funny how the things we tend to overlook are often the most important. When life gets tough, it's those neglected priorities that suddenly become crystal clear.

In a world where everyone seems to be living on autopilot, just going through the motions, there's not much time for deep thinking.
Why am I doing all this? Why am I spending so much time on these things?

Most of us are always glued to screens, busy with all sorts of entertainment, and worrying about what's coming next. 
But there's something really nice about just stopping for a minute, being quiet, and shutting off that automatic mode. 
It's like hitting pause on life and asking ourselves, "What's actually important?"
